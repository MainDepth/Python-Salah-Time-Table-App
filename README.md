# Python-Salah-Time-Table-App
This is the Salah Time Table that was made by me. It uses an api to calculate the Salah times. 

Feel free to donwload it and use it anyhow you like. Download the .py files or copy and paste them on an IDE/ text editor and save as "WHATEVER YOU WANT TO NAME THE FILE".py. 
To run it you will have to download python 3.8.

It is recommended that you use a python text editor / IDE such as PyCharm, Jupyter, VScode or the python IDLE.
